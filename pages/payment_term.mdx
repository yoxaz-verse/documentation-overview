## 🇮🇳 Domestic Payment Terms (Within India)

Domestic trade payment terms vary depending on the **commodity type**, **buyer reputation**, **urgency**, and **trust level**.

Here are the most commonly used domestic methods:

---

### 1. Advance Payment

- The buyer pays a portion (30–100%) of the total value before dispatch.
- The advance percentage depends on:
  - Risk level
  - Commodity nature
  - Supply urgency

✅ **Best for sellers** — secures initial commitment and reduces default risk.

---

### 2. LR-Based Payment (Lorry Receipt)

- Goods are dispatched, and the transport document (LR) is submitted to the buyer.
- Upon LR submission, the buyer releases the payment.

✅ **OBAOL Recommended**  
✅ Balanced and trusted for both parties  
✅ Ensures the seller has shipped and the buyer is ready to pay

---

### 3. Cash on Delivery (COD)

- Buyer pays only after receiving the goods.
- Payment is made post-inspection, typically in trusted relationships.

⚠️ **Risk for sellers** — if the buyer rejects the goods, it can lead to losses.

---

### 4. Credit-Based Payment

- Buyer receives the goods and pays later (7–60 days).
- Used in high-trust or long-term partnerships.

⚠️ **High risk** if no formal agreement is in place.

---

### 5. Letter of Credit (LC – Domestic Use)

- Buyer issues an LC via their bank.
- Seller receives payment upon fulfilling all LC terms.

✅ Ideal for high-value or first-time transactions  
✅ Legal and secure method even in domestic trades

---

## 🌍 International Payment Terms

International trades involve **bank-backed**, legally structured payments. Most are processed through formal banking channels like SWIFT or LC, not wallets or informal methods.

---

### 1. Advance Payment (International)

- Foreign buyer pays full or partial amount before dispatch.
- Sent via SWIFT, RTGS, IMPS, or other international transfer methods.

✅ **Low risk for sellers**, especially with small quantities or new buyers

---

### 2. Letter of Credit (LC)

- A legal bank guarantee from the buyer’s bank.
- Ensures payment is made only when specific trade terms are met.

Typically required:

- Shipment confirmation
- Documents: Bill of Lading, Invoice, Packing List, etc.

✅ **Highest level of security** for large-scale exports

---

### 3. Cash Against Documents (CAD)

- Seller submits shipment documents to buyer’s bank.
- Buyer pays before accessing documents and clearing the shipment.

Includes:

- Invoice
- LR or Bill of Lading
- Certificate of Origin
- Packing List

✅ Offers **better control** for sellers and ensures buyer’s commitment

---

### 4. Cash on Delivery (COD – International)

- Used rarely and only for small parcels via courier/export logistics.
- Not recommended for bulk or high-value trades.

⚠️ **High risk** — minimal protection for seller
