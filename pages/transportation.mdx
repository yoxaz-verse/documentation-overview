## 🇮🇳 Domestic Transportation in India

In India, agro commodities are primarily transported via the following methods:

---

### 🚛 1. Lorry / Truck Transport

- Most widely used for short- to mid-range trade across states.
- Suitable for both **Full Truck Load (FTL)** and **Part Truck Load (PTL)** consignments.

**Common Truck Types:**

| Type            | Capacity    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Normal Truck    | ~10–15 tons |
| Container Truck | ~16–21 tons |

✅ **Advantages**

- Flexible and accessible
- Cost-effective for regional trade
- Widely available across India

---

### 🚆 2. Railway Transport (Rack Booking)

- Used for **bulk shipments** over long distances.

**Booking Options:**

- Full Rack: ~2,600 quintals (~260 tons)
- Half Rack or Shared Rack

✅ **Advantages**

- Faster over long distances
- Efficient for large volumes
- Preferred by institutional buyers

⚠️ **Limitations**

- Requires high volumes
- More expensive than lorry for mid-range loads
- Booking and scheduling complexity

---

### 📦 3. Courier-Based / Small Logistics

- Suitable for **small orders** or **samples**
- Typically handled by third-party logistics providers (e.g., Kadam Courier)

✅ **Advantages**

## 🌍 International Transportation Methods

The logistics strategy for exports depends on **volume, urgency, destination country**, and **customs requirements**.

---

### 🚢 1. FCL – Full Container Load

- You book an entire container for your shipment.

**Container Sizes:**

| Type  | Capacity   |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 20 ft | ~28–30 CBM |
| 40 ft | ~55–60 CBM |

✅ **Advantages**

- Best suited for large, consolidated exports
- Lower cost per unit for bulk quantities
- Fewer handlers = less damage risk

---

### 📦 2. LCL – Less than Container Load

- Share container space with other exporters.

✅ **Advantages**

- Cost-efficient for smaller shipments
- Scalable for growing exporters

⚠️ **Limitations**

- Slower due to multiple handlers
- Higher risk of damage or delays

---

### ✈️ 3. Air Freight

- Fastest method for international shipments.

✅ **Use Cases**

- Urgent delivery timelines
- High-value, low-weight goods (e.g., spices, herbs)
- Samples or perishable items

⚠️ **Limitations**

- High cost per kilogram
- Volume limitations

---

### 🚚 4. Inland/Surface Transport (Cross-Border)

- Rare, but used in land-border trades:
  - India–Nepal
  - India–Bangladesh

✅ **Use Case:**

- Cross-border road networks for specific agreements

## ✨ Choosing the Right Transport Method

| Factor   | Domestic Options           | International Options                 |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Quantity | Lorry (small), Rack (bulk) | FCL (bulk), LCL (small), Air (urgent) |
| Speed    | Lorry < Rack               | Ship (slow), Air (fast)               |
| Cost     | Rack > Lorry > Courier     | FCL < LCL < Air                       |
| Risk     | Lower                      | Higher (customs, delays, damage)      |
